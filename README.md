# ExtendedStack
This is a submission to my algorithms course assignment. This was an 'ExtendedStack', where we had to support 4 other operations other than the standard stack ones. These operations involved manipulating the stack, and after said changes, find the max of the stack and the sum of the top 'x' number of elements. Operations were to be O(1), or at most O(log n).
